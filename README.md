# HyperParameterSearchForDEFormula

## What is it?
[DE formula](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kyotoms1969/9/3/9_3_721/_pdf), which stands for double exponential formulas for numerical integration, is a effective method for function which has singular points at end points of the interval. DE formula, however, has a issue that it is hard to decide hyper parameters, when a function is complex. This algorithm, using Newton method, provides a solution to it to some extent.
